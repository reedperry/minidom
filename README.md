# minidom
A JavaScript library for quickly creating DOM elements and adding them to the page.

I created this in 2017, and the basic functionality was there, but there were bugs and I never really fleshed it out.

I'm currently working on rewriting most of this library over on the [2020-overhaul](https://github.com/reedperry/minidom/tree/2020-overhaul) branch.
