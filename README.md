# minidom

`minidom` is a small JavaScript library for creating and adding DOM elements to a page. The API is meant to be user-friendly and intuitive.

I started this project in 2017, and got it to the point of being functional, but it was never finished or particularly nice to use. In the 2020-overhaul branch, I'm rewriting a lot of the codebase and fleshing out the functionality a bit more. This will be updated with some examples once the API is more stable!
