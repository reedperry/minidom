# minidom

`minidom` is a small JavaScript library for creating and adding DOM elements to a page. The API is meant to be user-friendly and intuitive.

I started this project in 2017, and got it to the point of being functional, but it was never finished. In the 2020-overhaul branch, I'm working on fleshing out the project a bit more, refactoring a lot of what was already here, and smoothing out the experience.
